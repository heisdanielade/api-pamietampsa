## Authentication

All protected endpoints require a **Bearer JWT token** in the `Authorization` header:

Authorization: Bearer < user-jwt-token>

---

## Rate Limiting

To protect public endpoints from abuse, this API applies rate limiting.

- Limit: 5 requests per minute per IP
- Affected routes: `/v1/auth/*`

If this limit is exceeded, requests return HTTP **429 Too Many Requests**.

---

## Email Notifications

Email events currently include:
- Successful user registration
- New pet added

Planned:
- Reminders for pet care
- Health record logs and alerts

---

## Work in Progress
This is an actively developed backend. Coming soon:

- Complete Reminders CRUD + Notification Triggers

- OAuth2.0 (Google & Facebook)

- Pet Health Record Management

- Rate limiting, role-based access control (RBAC), and other security hardening
